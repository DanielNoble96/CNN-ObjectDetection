# CNN-ObjectDetection

This is my research as a Graduate Math & Analytics R&D intern at Sandia National Laboratories. I cannot share my code because of company policy, but I will be including research posters and presentations of my work as they pass Review & Approval and can be shared publically. 

All of my work is implemented in Python and is focused on building CNNs and RCNNs for object detection problems. Using deep learning and image analysis libraries (tensorflow, scikit-learn, cv, keras), I've succesfully built a CNN that can classify various types of defects on scanning tunneling microscopy images of silicon surfaces. I'll be presenting a poster on my results thus far at the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies (CINT) conference, and when that poster clears R&A, I'll post it here.

## Next Steps

I'm currently working on an R-CNN to work on the defect localization problem that should be able to take a full image and segment that into sub-images centered around each defect, which can then be passed through my classification CNN.
